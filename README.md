## Known issues

- There is an unresolvable mod conflict with [TitleAPI](https://thunderstore.io/c/webfishing/p/LoafWF/TitleAPI/).
  And it cannot be used alongside Pip Pals. You can safely disable or uninstall it as it is an optional dependency.

## 1.4.2

- Hotfix for leveling up while you are reeling issue(s)
  - Please report any issues your encounter related to Pal-Power level-ups

- NEW Level 50 pip effect
- NEW Level 20 pip effect
- Changed jiggle effect to no longer show always -> on and after level 10

  - They were this way before powering up trigger animations and are not as necessary anymore

- Many other misc. changes!
